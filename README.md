# FMC-Amiga
FMC is a freeform node-based algorithm software synthesizer from 1989-1993.
Written in GFA BASIC, for compilation to a 68000 executable using GFA BASIC Compiler.

This code is not the latest version (1.05), but is v1.04, saved from OCR of a scan of a printout from 1993.
I have AmigaDOS 1.3/2.0 executables of FMC, as a distribution build, but that is not posted here.
